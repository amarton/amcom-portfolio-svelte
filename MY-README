Dev notes:

routes __layout.svelte is the page template for the site
app.html is the main page that pull in everything



PORTFOLIO:
Portfolio is populated dynamically based on data located in a JSON file.

THE DATA is located in static/port.json. 
    * In order to use internal JSON, I need to install rollups json plugin in the project folder

The MAIN PORTFOLIO PAGE is "routes/projects.svelte". It pulls in the json file and loops through it to display all. It sends the assigned id of each portfolio item to the individual portfolio pages via the url in the link button.

The INDIVIDUAL PORTFOLIO PAGES are located at "routes/portfolio/[id].svelte". This uses svelte's dynamic routing. The page pulls in the json file. Then it pulls the portfolio ID out of the url store (sent via the link on the main page) and selects the object from the JSON that has that same id.
